**Music-player**

The speaker is connected through the LM386 Audio Amplifier module. Vcc and GND pins of the Amplifier Module are connected to VIN and GND of ESP32 while IN pin of the Amplifier module is connected to GPIO 25 pin of ESP32. GPIO 25 is one of the 2 DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) pins.

**Getting Ready with Audio Files**

To play audio sounds on the ESP32 board, we need audio files in .wav format because ESP32 can play an audio file in .wav format only.

So the first step will be getting the file that you want to play on ESP32. After that, download and install the Audacity Audio Editor App. This app will be used to change the file type, Sample Rate, and other properties.

Once the installation is complete, open the Audacity app and then go to file > Open and select the audio file to edit.

The first thing that needed to be changed is the sampling rate. For playing an audio file on ESP32, a sampling rate of 8000 to 16000 will be good as ESP32 doesnâ€™t have much memory. So change the Project Rate to 16000.

After that, navigate to File > Export > Export as WAV to save the audio file in .wav format.

Now in the next window, select WAV (Microsoft) as file type and Unsigned 8-bit PCM as an Encoding format and then click on Save.

Now we need a Hex Editor app to generate Hex codes for the audio file. So download and install the Hex Editor (HxD) from the given link. After that, open the app, then go to File > open and open the .wav file. This will generate the Hex code for the .wav file.

Then use ctrl+A to select the complete code and then go to Edit > Copy as > C to copy the code in C Language format.

Then paste this code into Arduino IDE.

**Code Explanation**

The complete code for Contactless ESP32 Audio Player is given at the end of the page. Here we are explaining some important parts of code. In this program, we are going to use the XT DAC Audio library from XTronical. The XT DAC Audio library can be downloaded from here.

So as usual, start the code by including all the required libraries. SoundData.h file contains the Hex code for the .Wav file that is to be played.

#include "SoundData.h"
#include "XT_DAC_Audio.h"

In the next line, create an object of type XT_Wav_Class that is used by the DAC audio class passing .wav data as a parameter. DacAudio, the main player class object in which 25 is the DAC pin number where the amplifier pin is connected.

XT_Wav_Class Sound(sample);
XT_DAC_Audio_Class DacAudio(25,0);

Inside the setup() function, initialize the Serial Monitor at a baud rate of 115200 for debugging purposes.

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
Inside the loop() function, fill the sound buffer with data and check if the sound is playing or not, if not, play the sound in the loop.

void loop() {
  DacAudio.FillBuffer();               
  if(Sound.Playing==false)      
    DacAudio.Play(&Sound);      
  Serial.println(DemoCounter++);      
}
